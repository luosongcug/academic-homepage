abstract: |
  The 3 September 2017 nuclear test conducted by the Democratic People's Republic
  of Korea was followed by a series of small seismic events. In this study,
  we conduct a survey of small seismic events from 1 May 2017 to 25 April 2018
  near North Korea's nuclear test site. We report 88 seismic events, including
  the 2017 nuclear test, the collapse event 8.5 min later, and 86 earthquakes
  afterward. Among the 86 earthquakes, 11 are well constrained to be distributed
  along a near north–south direction within a region of 2 km, ∼8.4 km north of
  the test site. The null detection before the 2017 test and the intense seismicity
  after the test, along with the predicted normal tensile stress the 2017 test
  applied on the fault, provide strong evidence that the 2017 test triggered
  these earthquakes. Some characteristics (the distance to the nuclear test center,
  depth, and magnitude) of these triggered aftershocks fit the general characteristics
  of the aftershocks in the Nevada National Security Site and the Semipalatinsk
  test site after nuclear tests, but the aftershocks of North Korea’s 2017 test
  exhibit a different evolution lasting at least eight months with two bursts
  occurring on early December 2017 and early February 2018 and an otherwise
  general low occurrence rate, possibly caused by a different geological
  setting of the test site.
