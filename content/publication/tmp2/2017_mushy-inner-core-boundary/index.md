abstract: |
  Although existence of a mushy zone in the Earth's inner core has been
  hypothesized several decades ago, no seismic evidence has ever been reported.
  Based on waveform modeling of seismic compressional waves that are reflected
  off the Earth's inner core boundary, here we present seismic evidence for
  a localized 4–8 km thick zone across the inner core boundary beneath southwest
  Okhotsk Sea with seismic properties intermediate between those of the inner and
  outer core and of a mushy zone. Such a localized mushy zone is found to be
  surrounded by a sharp inner core boundary nearby. These seismic results suggest
  that, in the current thermo-compositional state of the Earth’s core, the outer
  core composition is close to eutectic in most regions resulting in a sharp
  inner core boundary, but deviation from the eutectic composition exists
  in some localized regions resulting in a mushy zone with a thickness of 4–8 km.
