abstract: |
  We find that microseisms generated by Hurricane Sandy exhibit coherent energy
  within 1 h time windows in the frequency band of 0.1–0.25 Hz, but with signals
  correlated among seismic stations aligned along close azimuths from the
  hurricane center. With the identification of this signal property, we show
  that travel time difference can be measured between the correlated stations.
  These correlated seismic signals can be attributed to two types of seismic
  sources, with one group of the seismic signals from the hurricane center and
  the other from coastal region. The seismic sources in coastal region are
  diffusive and move northward along the coastline as Sandy moves northward.
  We further develop a hurricane seismic source model, to quantitatively describe
  the coupling among sea level pressure fluctuations, ocean waves, and solid Earth
  in the region of hurricane center and determine the evolution of source's
  strength and pressure fluctuation in the region of hurricane center using
  seismic data. Strong seismic sources are also identified near the coastal region
  in New England after Sandy's dissipation, possibly related to subsequent storm
  surge in the area. The seismic method may be implemented as another practical
  means for hurricane monitoring, and seismological estimates of the hurricane
  seismic source model could be used as in situ proxy measurements of pressure
  fluctuation in the region of hurricane center for hurricane physics studies.
