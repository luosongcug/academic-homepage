abstract: |
  Deep earthquakes exhibit strong variabilities in their rupture and aftershock
  characteristics, yet their physical failure mechanisms remain elusive.
  The 2018 Mw 8.2 and Mw 7.9 Tonga-Fiji deep earthquakes, the two largest ever
  recorded in this subduction zone, occurred within days of each other.
  We investigate these events by performing waveform analysis,
  teleseismic P-wave back-projection, and aftershock relocation.
  Our results show that the Mw 8.2 earthquake ruptured fast (4.1 km/s) and
  excited frequency dependent seismic radiation, whereas the Mw 7.9 earthquake
  ruptured slowly (2.5 km/s). Both events lasted ~35 s. The Mw 8.2 earthquake
  initiated in the highly seismogenic, cold core of the slab and likely
  ruptured into the surrounding warmer materials, whereas the Mw 7.9 earthquake
  likely ruptured through a dissipative process in a previously aseismic region.
  The contrasts in earthquake kinematics and aftershock productivity argue for
  a combination of at least two primary mechanisms enabling rupture in the region.
