abstract: |
  North Korea's 3 September 2017 nuclear test was followed by several small
  seismic events, with one eight‐and‐a‐half minutes after the test and three
  on and after 23 September 2017. Seismic analysis reveals that the first event
  is a near vertical on‐site collapse toward the nuclear test center from 440±260 m
  northwest of the test site, with its seismic source best represented by
  a single force with a dip angle of 70°–75° and an azimuth of ~150°, and
  the later events are an earthquake swarm located 8.4±1.7 km north of the test site
  within a region of 520 m, with a focal depth of at least 2.4 km and
  a focal mechanism of nearly pure strike slip along the north‐south direction
  with a high dip angle of 50°–90°. The occurrence of the on‐site collapse calls for
  continued monitoring of any leaks of radioactive materials from the test site.

# Summary. An optional shortened abstract.
summary: |
  1. We present high-precision locations and detailed source information of
     four small seismic events following North Korea's 2017 nuclear test.
  2. The first event is an on-site collapse 440 m northwest of the test site
     and best explained by a near vertical single force.
  3. The later events are an earthquake swarm located 8.4 km north of the test
     site with a focal depth of at least 2.4 km.
