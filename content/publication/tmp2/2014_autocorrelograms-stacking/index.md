abstract: |
  Accurate determination of earthquake depth is important, but particularly
  challenging. We develop a new method to determine the earthquake source depth
  by stacking multiple-station autocorrelograms (SMAC) of seismic data.
  The basic concept of SMAC method is to enhance the coherent surface reflected
  energy by autocorrelation and stacking, and uses the surface reflected energy
  to determine the source depth. Autocorrelation effectively enhances the energy
  of the seismic phases related to the source depth, while stacking the
  autocorrelograms of array data further improves the signal-to-noise ratio of
  the energy. The procedures are applied using both the main SH waves and the coda.
  Using coda waves, the method extracts the two-way traveltime between the source
  and the surface by stacking the coda wave autocorrelations over an array of
  seismic observations. Using the main SH waves, SMAC explores the interference
  of the down-going Moho reflected SmS wave and up-going surface bounced Moho
  reflected sSmS wave by autocorrelation. The autocorrelograms are then stacked
  along theoretical differential sSmS–SmS traveltime predicted for all potential
  source depths, and the source depth is determined to be the one that produces
  the maximum stacking energy. Synthetic tests demonstrate the validity of the
  SMAC procedures. As an example of application, we apply the SMAC method to
  determine the source depth of an earthquake occurring in Japan Island.
  The procedures of using both main SH waves and their coda waves yield robust
  surface reflected energy and a consistent source depth. The error of the depth
  estimation is less than 1 km assuming an uncertainty of 10 per cent
  in the averaged crust velocity.
