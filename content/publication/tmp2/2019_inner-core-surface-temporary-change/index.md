abstract: |
  We discuss the question whether inner core (IC) differential rotation or
  temporal change of the IC surface provides a consistent interpretation
  for temporal changes of the IC‐related phases and their coda. While temporal
  change of the IC surface is required and provides a consistent explanation to
  all the seismic observations, we present three lines of seismic evidence
  showing that IC differential rotation cannot provide a consistent or
  reasonable interpretation for the observed temporal change of seismic waves
  from repeating earthquakes in the South Sandwich Islands (SSI) and the Middle
  America subduction zone. (1) Changed PKIKP/PKiKP coda between events
  in a doublet in SSI indicates an IC surface scatterer that simply disappeared,
  with no associated energy in the later event for any assumed IC differential
  rotation. (2) Within a cluster in SSI, comparisons between temporal changes of
  PKIKP wave and its coda of the earlier and later event pairs yield contradictory
  estimates of differential rotation rate change by a factor of at least 27,
  using different portions of seismic data. (3) The seismic data from repeating
  earthquakes in Middle America indicate a PKiKP temporal change of 0.017–0.04 s
  on a timescale of 8–85 days, requiring an unreasonable rotation rate of
  at least 8.6°/year. We conclude that the observed temporal changes of IC phases
  are caused by temporal changes of the IC surface, which occur in some localized
  regions within a timescale of days or months, a phenomenon that should provide
  important clues to our understanding of core dynamics.
