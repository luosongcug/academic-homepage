abstract: |
  We investigate seismic discontinuities in the mantle transition zone (MTZ)
  by analyzing SS precursors recorded at global seismic stations. Our observations
  confirm the global existence of the 520-km discontinuity. Although substantial
  regional depth variations in the 520-km discontinuity are generally correlated
  with temperature in the mid-MTZ, they cannot be fully explained by
  the Clapeyron slope of the wadsleyite-ringwoodite phase transition,
  suggesting both thermal and compositional heterogeneities in the MTZ.
  A second discontinuity at ∼560-km depth, previously interpreted as splitting
  of the 520-km discontinuity, is most commonly detected in cold subduction zones
  and hot mantle regions. The depth separation between the 520- and 560-km
  discontinuities varies from ∼80 km in cold regions to ∼40 km in hot areas.
  The exsolution of calcium-perovskite (Ca-pv) from majorite garnet has been
  proposed to explain the velocity and density changes across the 560-km discontinuity.
  However, the gradual exsolution of perovskite and partitioning of Ca and Al
  between perovskite and garnet appear inconsistent with the relatively "sharp"
  discontinuity in seismic observations and thus need to be revisited in the future.
  Nevertheless, because the only known transition in major minerals at this depth
  in the MTZ is the formation of Ca-pv, the existence of the 560-km discontinuity
  may imply localized high calcium concentrations in the mid-MTZ possibly related
  to the recycling of oceanic crust.

summary: |
  1. We perform a global survey of the 520- and 560-km mantle discontinuity by
     analyzing SS precursors.
  2. Our observations confirm the global existence of the 520-km discontinuity.
  3. Depth variations of the 520-km discontinuity correlate with the mid-MTZ temperature.
  4. Compositional heterogeneity also contributes to the 520-km discontinuity topography.
  5. A 560-km discontinuity is sporadically detected in subduction zones and mantle upwells.
  6. The existence of the 560-km discontinuity may imply localized Ca-enrichment
     in the mid-MTZ possibly related to the recycling of oceanic crust.
