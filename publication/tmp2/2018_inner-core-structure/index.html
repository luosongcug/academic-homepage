The interior of the Earth’s inner core exhibits both velocity and attenuation anisotropy,
and hemispherical variations of velocity, attenuation and anisotropy, while the surface of
the inner core possesses topography and mushy zone in some localized regions.
The inner core velocity and attenuation anisotropy is cylindrical with the axis of high velocity
and high attenuation parallel with the Earth's rotation axis, and depth dependent with the topmost
100–400 km close to be isotropic and the innermost 300–600 km possibly possessing a distinct anisotropy.
The hemispherical variations in the inner core are manifested in many aspects: the isotropic velocity of
the topmost ~100 km of the eastern hemisphere is 0.8% faster than that of the western hemisphere,
the attenuation in the top ~100 km of the eastern hemisphere (Q=250) is stronger than that of the
western hemisphere (Q=600), the top isotropic layer is thinner in the western hemisphere (~100 km)
than in the eastern hemisphere (~400 km), and the inner core anisotropy in the western hemisphere (~4%)
is stronger than in the eastern hemisphere (~0.7%). In the boundary, the inner core exhibits
topographic variations with height changes of 1–14 km beneath the Philippine Sea, the Yellow Sea,
the western Pacific and Central America, and a mushy zone with a thickness of 4–8 km beneath
the southwest Okhotsk Sea. These new findings have motivated a series of new physical mechanisms in the
scientific community and demand for reevaluation of outer core composition, thermal-compositional convection
in the outer core, inner core solidification process and driving force of Earth's geodynamo.
These results suggest that the inner core solidification process and the driving force of Earth's
geodynamo are not laterally homogeneous, as it has long been held in the traditional views.
Solidification may occur in the western hemisphere releasing latent heat and light elements,
while melting may occur in the eastern hemisphere absorbing latent heat and light elements.
Therefore, the driving forces for the outer core convection in these two hemispheres may be
different and may even be in opposite signs. Such alternative solidification and melting should
also occur in the localized topographic regions. Moreover, the solidification in the region of
a mushy zone would release both thermal and chemical energy, while that in other regions of
a sharp inner core boundary only releases thermal energy.

The interior of the Earth’s inner core exhibits both velocity and attenuation anisotropy,
and hemispherical variations of velocity, attenuation and anisotropy, while the surface of
the inner core possesses topography and mushy zone in some localized regions.
The inner core velocity and attenuation anisotropy is cylindrical with the axis of high velocity
and high attenuation parallel with the Earth&rsquo;s rotation axis, and depth dependent with the topmost
100–400 km close to be isotropic and the innermost 300–600 km possibly possessing a distinct anisotropy.
The hemispherical variations in the inner core are manifested in many aspects: the isotropic velocity of
the topmost ~100 km of the eastern hemisphere is 0.8% faster than that of the western hemisphere,
the attenuation in the top ~100 km of the eastern hemisphere (Q=250) is stronger than that of the
western hemisphere (Q=600), the top isotropic layer is thinner in the western hemisphere (~100 km)
than in the eastern hemisphere (~400 km), and the inner core anisotropy in the western hemisphere (~4%)
is stronger than in the eastern hemisphere (~0.7%). In the boundary, the inner core exhibits
topographic variations with height changes of 1–14 km beneath the Philippine Sea, the Yellow Sea,
the western Pacific and Central America, and a mushy zone with a thickness of 4–8 km beneath
the southwest Okhotsk Sea. These new findings have motivated a series of new physical mechanisms in the
scientific community and demand for reevaluation of outer core composition, thermal-compositional convection
in the outer core, inner core solidification process and driving force of Earth&rsquo;s geodynamo.
These results suggest that the inner core solidification process and the driving force of Earth&rsquo;s
geodynamo are not laterally homogeneous, as it has long been held in the traditional views.
Solidification may occur in the western hemisphere releasing latent heat and light elements,
while melting may occur in the eastern hemisphere absorbing latent heat and light elements.
Therefore, the driving forces for the outer core convection in these two hemispheres may be
different and may even be in opposite signs. Such alternative solidification and melting should
also occur in the localized topographic regions. Moreover, the solidification in the region of
a mushy zone would release both thermal and chemical energy, while that in other regions of
a sharp inner core boundary only releases thermal energy.</p><div class=row><div class=col-md-1></div><div class=col-md-10><div class=row><div class="col-12 col-md-3 pub-row-heading">Type</div><div class="col-12 col-md-9"><a href=/academic-homepage/publication/#2>Journal article</a></div></div></div><div class=col-md-1></div></div><div class="d-md-none space-below"></div><div class=row><div class=col-md-1></div><div class=col-md-10><div class=row><div class="col-12 col-md-3 pub-row-heading">Publication</div><div class="col-12 col-md-9"><em>Chinese Journal of Geophysics (in Chinese)</em></div></div></div><div class=col-md-1></div></div><div class="d-md-none space-below"></div><div class=space-below></div><div class=article-style></div><div class=share-box><ul class=share><li><a href="https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?url=https%3A%2F%2Fluosongcug.github.io%2Facademic-homepage%2Fpublication%2Ftmp2%2F2018_inner-core-structure%2F&text=Seismic+structure+and+dynamic+process+of+the+Earth%27s+inner+core+and+its+boundary" target=_blank rel=noopener class=share-btn-twitter aria-label=twitter><i class="fab fa-twitter"></i></a></li><li><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer.php?u=https%3A%2F%2Fluosongcug.github.io%2Facademic-homepage%2Fpublication%2Ftmp2%2F2018_inner-core-structure%2F&t=Seismic+structure+and+dynamic+process+of+the+Earth%27s+inner+core+and+its+boundary" target=_blank rel=noopener class=share-btn-facebook aria-label=facebook><i class="fab fa-facebook"></i></a></li><li><a href="mailto:?subject=Seismic%20structure%20and%20dynamic%20process%20of%20the%20Earth%27s%20inner%20core%20and%20its%20boundary&body=https%3A%2F%2Fluosongcug.github.io%2Facademic-homepage%2Fpublication%2Ftmp2%2F2018_inner-core-structure%2F" target=_blank rel=noopener class=share-btn-email aria-label=envelope><i class="fas fa-envelope"></i></a></li><li><a href="https://www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=https%3A%2F%2Fluosongcug.github.io%2Facademic-homepage%2Fpublication%2Ftmp2%2F2018_inner-core-structure%2F&title=Seismic+structure+and+dynamic+process+of+the+Earth%27s+inner+core+and+its+boundary" target=_blank rel=noopener class=share-btn-linkedin aria-label=linkedin-in><i class="fab fa-linkedin-in"></i></a></li><li><a href="whatsapp://send?text=Seismic+structure+and+dynamic+process+of+the+Earth%27s+inner+core+and+its+boundary%20https%3A%2F%2Fluosongcug.github.io%2Facademic-homepage%2Fpublication%2Ftmp2%2F2018_inner-core-structure%2F" target=_blank rel=noopener class=share-btn-whatsapp aria-label=whatsapp><i class="fab fa-whatsapp"></i></a></li><li><a href="https://service.weibo.com/share/share.php?url=https%3A%2F%2Fluosongcug.github.io%2Facademic-homepage%2Fpublication%2Ftmp2%2F2018_inner-core-structure%2F&title=Seismic+structure+and+dynamic+process+of+the+Earth%27s+inner+core+and+its+boundary" target=_blank rel=noopener class=share-btn-weibo aria-label=weibo><i class="fab fa-weibo"></i></a></li></ul></div><div class="media author-card content-widget-hr"><a href=https://luosongcug.github.io/academic-homepage/><img class="avatar mr-3 avatar-circle" src=/academic-homepage/authors/admin/avatar_hu1e892de67580c954058956274e973a82_1340886_270x270_fill_lanczos_center_3.png alt="Song Luo"></a><div class=media-body><h5 class=card-title><a href=https://luosongcug.github.io/academic-homepage/>Song Luo</a></h5><h6 class=card-subtitle>Associate Researcher</h6><ul class=network-icon aria-hidden=true><li><a href=https://orcid.org/0000-0002-4244-844X target=_blank rel=noopener><i class="ai ai-orcid"></i></a></li><li><a href="https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=6Izz2e8AAAAJ&hl=en" target=_blank rel=noopener><i class="ai ai-google-scholar"></i></a></li><li><a href=https://github.com/luosongcug target=_blank rel=noopener><i class="fab fa-github"></i></a></li><li><a href=https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Song-Luo-5 target=_blank rel=noopener><i class="ai ai-researchgate"></i></a></li><li><a href=/academic-homepage/songluo@ustc.edu.cn><i class="fas fa-envelope"></i></a></li></ul></div></div></div></div></div><div class=page-footer><div class=container><footer class=site-footer><p class="powered-by copyright-license-text">© 2023 Song Luo.
